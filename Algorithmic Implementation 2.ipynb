    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To transition from simple Hamming distance (which only handles strings of equal length) to a robust algorithm capable of measuring similarity between any two strings or phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology \n",
    "\n",
    "The core of this section is the implementation of the **Levenshtein Distance algorithm**. The primary difference between the Hamming distance(error detection/correction (e.g., Hamming codes), DNA sequence comparison) and the Levenshtein distance (spell correction, natural language processing (NLP), bioinformatics) is that Hamming distance only allows substitutions for equal-length strings, while Levenshtein distance allows insertions, deletions, and substitutions for strings of any length. Unlike basic methods, this approach uses dynamic programming to calculate the minimum number of \"edits\" (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one string into another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm constructs a matrix where each cell $(i,j)$ represents the minimum number of operations to transform the first $i$ characters of string $A$ into the first $j$ characters of string $B$. The final value in the bottom-right cell of the matrix is the total Edit Distance. This approach is superior to Hamming distance because it accounts for shifts in character positions caused by additions or removals, rather than just comparing characters at identical indices."
